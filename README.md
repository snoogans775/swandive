##What is this?
This is a collection of experimental Go programs
Each program should be provided some kind of graphical interface
Ideally, these interfaces should be accessible via web browsers
This is achieved by compiling to WebAssembly when it is not painful to do that
In some cases, there might be HTML or Javascript interfaces that reach into WebAssembly-compiled Go programs
It's really not too important that this make sense.
It's important that things are made in the spirit of [Swandive](https://soundcloud.com/user-47939846)
